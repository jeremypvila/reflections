diff makes it easy to locate changes between files, especially when they are large.

Access to the entire history of a file ensures you can compare any two versions to spot bugs.

When choosing to commit a file on on command vs. automatically, the commits make logical sense.

Some version control save files separately because the files arent dependent.  Git is able to commit multiple files because they are related to a single change in functionality.

you can use git log and git giff to view history of files by first spotting the commit with git log, then viewing differences with git diff.

Using version control removes the fear of having bugs in code.  You can always undo.

I want to use git to better collaborate with my team.
