    You might want to stay at a given version of the code

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    clone is a copy of a git repository stored locally.  
    Branches are experimental deviations from another series of commits.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
